This project is in continuation with my 11th grade project ([Pulkit_Eatries](https://github.com/Pulkitxm/Pulkit_Eatries)). This is an extension to the previous project extending functionalities like:
- To show some animated text I had added a time.sleep(speed)
https://github.com/Pulkitxm/Goose_Foot/blob/bcee48cd74b6b7d063a39b8e08e9cc57ab097ddf/Function.py#L48
- To represnt an OTP system I generated a random OTP and wrote it in a file using file handling and opened it using os module os.system('start otp.txt')
https://github.com/Pulkitxm/Goose_Foot/blob/bcee48cd74b6b7d063a39b8e08e9cc57ab097ddf/Signin.py#L41
- Then same menu and item selection like in prev. one
- Then a restaurant selection is showed using a loader using time.sleep(), then showing some random restaurants
- At last a delivery patner system is added which is fetched from sql db
